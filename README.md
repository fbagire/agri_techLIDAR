Assume we are very interested in how water flows through a maize farm field.

How much maize a field produces is very spatially variable. Even if the same farming practices, seeds and fertilizer are applied exactly the same by machinery over a field, there can be a very large harvest at one corner and a low harvest at another corner.  We would like to be able to better understand which parts of the farm are likely to produce more or less maize, so that if we try a new fertilizer on part of this farm, we have more confidence that any differences in the maize harvest 9are due mostly to the new fertilizer changes, and not just random effects due to other environmental factors.
